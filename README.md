# Lazarus: The Intelligent Artificial Pancreas
Lazarus of Bethany, also known as Saint Lazarus or Lazarus of the Four Days, is the subject of a prominent miracle of Jesus in the Gospel of John, in which Jesus restores him to life four days after his death. This project has no religious affiliation, but the idea of the tale of Lazarus is a very interesting one and a neat concept to think about for my medical research. As long as we don't create a zombie apocalype, that is.

This project is a minimal, efficient, deep q learning algorithm implementation which facilitates high performance machine learning in embedded contexts. The Lazarus project uses a hardware platform to autonomously deliver insulin without the need of intervention by the patient suffering from diabetes.
